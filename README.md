# 🐱🐶 Cat and Dog Classification using CNN

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of **cats and dogs**. It demonstrates how to use **OpenCV (cv2)** for image processing and **Matplotlib** for visualizations.

## 📌 About the Project

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can differentiate between cat and dog images. This serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to image classification tasks using CNNs, along with tools for handling images and visualizing results.

### Key Features:
- Custom CNN model built from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV for image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Matplotlib for plotting training history and displaying sample predictions
- Clean and modular code structure
